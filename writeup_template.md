# Udacity Project 5 - Vehicle Lane Detection

The aim of this project is to build a pipeline to detect cars from windshield mounted camera. This is done using traditional computer vision techniques.

 Training Data Overview
---

The project repository on the Udacity github has links to two prepreared data sets. The first containing [images of vehicles](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/Vehicle_Tracking/vehicles.zip) and the second conatining images of [of no vehicles](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/Vehicle_Tracking/non-vehicles.zip).

[Rubric Points](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/513/view)

### Explain how (and identify where in your code) you extracted HOG features from the training images. Explain how you settled on your final choice of HOG parameters


### Describe how (and identify where in your code) you trained a classifier using your selected HOG features (and color features if you used them).


### Describe how (and identify where in your code) you implemented a sliding window search. How did you decide what scales to search and how much to overlap windows?


### Show some examples of test images to demonstrate how your pipeline is working. How did you optimize the performance of your classifier?
